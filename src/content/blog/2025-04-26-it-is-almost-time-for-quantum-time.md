It's been years since we ran around the world with Jack, Sarah and Kara. Well, now is the 
time
 to rejoin our friends on a new adventure. Picking up where we left off, come explore the world of Quotient in the new novel, 
Quantum Time
. It's another globe trotting adventure. The novel will be available exclusively on Amazon, with Paperback, Kindle, and Audiobook formats available for your enjoyment! (and this time, I narrate the audiobook myself,) Your feedback and comments are always welcome.

I appreciate you joining me on these adventures!

​Greg

Here's a review from Reader's Favorite's: 

"Lovers of time travel, sci-fi, and espionage thrillers will not be able to peel their eyes off this action-packed, fast-paced page-turner -- Gregory expertly unfolded the storyline with a double timeline -- The spell-binding plot twists and subtle tone had me on the edge of my seat. -- This is the type of story that has you holding your breath as the protagonists face invincible villains, all the while treating you to brilliant adventure, drama, thrills, and romance." - Keith Mbuya, Readers' Favorite, 5 Stars
