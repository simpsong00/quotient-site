Quantum Time is almost here! Thank you for your patience in waiting for the follow-up to The Quantum Contingent. The book is written and the audiobook is recorded.

Here's the draft blurb. (It still needs some work!)

Jack and Sarah, sibling spies for Quotient–a global independent spy agency–are back. Vacation is cut short as they work to save President O’Connor and other world leaders from a wind of death. They must race against time in this globe-trotting, techno-spy thriller to save today and tomorrow. Set in two different timelines, the near future of 2028 as well as the far future of 2050, our team is stretched trying to stop multiple threats at once.  
Quantum Time
 is an exciting glimpse of the future with richly detailed locations and today’s technologies extrapolated for tomorrow. With its own Spotify playlist and an action-packed story, this is one read you won’t want to miss.

Your comments on the blurb are appreciated! (and of course there is a Spotify Playlist. Here's the link:
