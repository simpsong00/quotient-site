I listened to a 
First Line Frenzy
 stream today by @RFaithEditorial in conjunction with Reedsy. In first line frenzy, an editor, Rebecca Faith, quickly critiques the opening line in a long list of novels, It's an interesting way to pick up some good tips to consider when working on your book. Anyway, I thought I'd try it with you, my blog audience. Here's the opening line to 
The Quantum Contingent
:

Thud! The wood beside Jack’s ear splintered as the carbon blade dug into the old willow tree next to him. In a split second, Jack swiveled, crouched, and launched himself across the lane like a mountain lion bounding after its prey.

Frenzy away! You are the editor. Give me your critique in the comments or on twitter/linkedin or wherever you saw this blog post!

Thanks and talk to you next week!

Greg
