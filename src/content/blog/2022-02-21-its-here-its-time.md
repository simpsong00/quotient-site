I am pleased to announce that 
The Quantum Contingent
 has launched. 
The Quantum Contingent
 is a 
globe-trotting, techno-spy thriller with pop-culture references and even its own Spotify playlist. It is set in richly detailed locations around the globe and features today’s technologies, extrapolated for tomorrow, including cryptocurrency, drones, and SpaceX rocket ships. 
I hope you'll join me on this adventure. Let me know what you think!

In August of 2021, the National Security Agency released a document stating the following: 

“The impact of adversarial use of a quantum computer could be devastating to NSS and our Nation…”

In 2028, that day has arrived. A mysterious group known as The Quantum Contingent has achieved true quantum computing capabilities. The Quantum Contingent have their sights set on achieving immortality for a select few that will chart humanity’s destiny. They are willing to hold the world’s governments hostage to achieve their goal.

Jack and Sarah, sibling spies, race across the globe at a frenetic pace to stop this nefarious group and their anonymous founder. Jack and Sarah are part of Quotient, a mysterious, independent, spy agency whose secret advantage is also quantum based.
