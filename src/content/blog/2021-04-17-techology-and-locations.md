One of the things that's good to do when you write a novel is to write what you know. I've been in technology for many years, and it is a passion of mine, so it made sense for me to incorporate technology into the novel. In my opinion, there is no better genre to incorporate technology than the spy novel. Q was the technology leader for MI-6 in the famous James Bond series and Q was also an omnipotent villain in Star Trek, The Next Generation. It only seemed natural that I'd opt for a techno-thriller with spies and even a bit of outer space thrown in. You may even find a Q character in my novel.

I've also been lucky to have seen a lot of the world over the years. I took the photo at the top of this blog at Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. Writing was easiest when I was talking about technology in settings I had experienced first hand. This is how I ended up with the technology and locations sections of the website. I was initially collecting the links to include in the back of the book, but it was unreasonable to assume anyone would type in some of the long links to different articles in the back of a novel. So, I wanted to collect them all in one place. I hope you'll find the links more interesting after you read the novel. I'll do a deep dive on the technology that is core to my novel, quantum computing, in my next blog post.

For fun, I've included a photo I took that is described in the book below. Can you name where it is from, and what literary work it may have inspired?

Talk soon,

Greg

							The picture shown here is in Oxford England, where C.S.Lewis was both a student and a teacher. This doorway was one of the inspirations for the Chronicles of Narnia. It has the Lion carved in the door, the fauns, part human, part goat in the ornamental carvings surrounding the door and just down this passage is a single Lamp post (not shown) as in Narnia.

							Thanks Ron. All of the technology listed has made it in! I might even get a few more references on there before the book is finished.
