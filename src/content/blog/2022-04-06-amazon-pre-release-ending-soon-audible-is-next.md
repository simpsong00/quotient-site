The Amazon pre-release sale is set to end April 12th. Based on activity on the pre-release page, (both pre-release sales and the number of people who simply browse the page) Amazon will estimate how many copies it will sell in what parts of the country and place orders for its warehouses both in the US and abroad! Once it has the physical copies in its warehouses, Amazon will end the pre-sale, and begin shipping books to those who pre-ordered and the book will show as "available" instead of as for "pre-sale" on Amazon's site.

If you haven't purchased your copy yet, now is the time!
 Pre-release sales are a big factor in how many copies Amazon stocks, so thanks to all who purchase one!

I've gotten 4 reviews so far from readers of the Kindle version of The Quantum Contingent. All 5 stars! Your reviews help sell books, so if you are so inclined, I'd appreciate you taking the time to do a review. Special thanks to those who already did!

For those of you that prefer to listen to books instead of read them, never fear, the audio book is coming! I'm working on the Audible version with my narrator, Stephen Carter, entrepreneur extraordinaire, and founder of The Seed Tree Group. Read about Stephen and his recent book on his 
[Amazon Author page](https://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Carter/e/B09GN2DRVF/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_ebooks_1)
.
 Stephen has recorded the first 38 chapters already. I'll let you know when the audible version of The Quantum Contingent launches!

Remember, The Quantum Contingent makes a great gift!

Enjoy your day! Talk soon, 

​Greg
