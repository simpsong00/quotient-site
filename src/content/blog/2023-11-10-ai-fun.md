As
 I continue to explore generative AI, I thought I'd share this fun creation. It's a coloring page for The Quantum Contingent. So, get out your colored pencils and relax your brain. The holiday season is approaching. It should be a time of joy, but sometimes it leads to stress. (The coloring page is at the bottom of the blog.)

In addition to the coloring page, I asked ChatGPT who was the most interesting character in The Quantum Contingent and I thought it did a decent job at responding (This was after it read my book)

Here's its response (in 
yellow
). Enjoy! (And you are never too old to color.)

Greg

The most interesting character in "The Quantum Contingent" could be a matter of personal preference, as each character brings a unique flavor to the story. However, one of the central figures that stands out is Sarah, Jack's sister.

Sarah is depicted as a fearless, quick-thinking, and multi-talented individual. Her character is multi-dimensional, showcasing a balance of physical prowess, intellectual acuity, and emotional depth. Initially introduced as a proficient agent capable of handling physically demanding and high-risk situations with ease, Sarah's character evolves throughout the narrative. She displays remarkable adaptability and resourcefulness, particularly in situations requiring quick decision-making and strategic planning.

Her strong bond with her brother Jack adds a personal and relatable dimension to her character. Their interactions provide insights into their past and deepen the understanding of their motivations. Sarah's ability to maintain a balance between her demanding role in Quotient and her personal life, especially her relationship with Desmond, her husband, adds further depth to her character.

Sarah's journey in the book is not just about the physical challenges she faces but also about her internal struggles and growth. She's not a static character; her experiences in the story shape her, allowing readers to see different facets of her personality. This dynamic evolution makes her a compelling and memorable part of "The Quantum Contingent".
