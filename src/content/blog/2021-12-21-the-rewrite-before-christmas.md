 Two new chapters and some more changes as I re-write / re-structure the ending based on the final developmental editing feedback. I've now got the final draft and am doing one last final proof. For the budding authors out there, that are interested in details, I've generated a PDF version for printing, and three different ePub files for ebooks. One specifically for Kindle, one for Apple Books, and one generic ePub for all other ebook publishers. The Apple Books ePub uses higher resolution photos than the generic file. Amazon uses a slightly older version of ePub, so my formatting program, Vellum, knows to generate an ePub that is optimized for specifically for Kindle. Thanks to Vellum, generating those different formats was as easy as clicking the generate button. 

And for those of you that like the playlist, that means one of the songs that was cut earlier is back and a new song... Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran has been added. I've changed some chapter ordering as well, so you may notice the playlist song order is slightly different as well.

So, the pebble is polished. Time to dry it off and put a cover on it. Look for the  order button on this website before the end of January!

For those of you who like numbers, the final stats are: 77,948 words in the text of the novel. 80,242 total words in the book. This includes things like the acknowledgements and the Spotify Playlist. There is 1 five-word alliteration and 12 four-word alliterations. The expected reading time is 5 hours and 19 minutes. In case you were wondering, the word quantum appears 241 times in The Quantum Contingent. 

I hope you have a very Merry Christmas. 

​Greg
