 Libraries make an entire world of reading available to everyone! Sometimes book clubs avoid buying books because they don't want to collect so many copies, but they enjoy reading. 
Some people can't afford to buy a book just for fun. Fortunately, we have libraries! 
The first known library was in Nineveh; in what is today Iraq. It was established in the 7th century BCE by the Assyrian ruler Ashurbanipal. It was thought to hold about 30,000 cuneiform tablets, organized by different topics.

Libraries solve the problem of access to knowledge by making reading treasures (and increasingly movies, songs and other literary works) available to communities for free. Today's libraries are still treasure holds of great works, but in addition to physical works, they also have digital works. The Quantum Contingent is available in many libraries today digitally via Hoopla, a digital media service available in libraries around the U.S. and Canada. Here's a map of the libraries that Hoopla partners with and the areas they cover. Read more about Hoopla at:

So, if you want to check out The Quantum Contingent, but aren't ready to buy a copy for any reason, you can check it out via Hoopla and many local libraries! If you are part of a book club and would like to buy The Quantum Contingent as a group, contact me for a book club group discount! 

Talk soon,
