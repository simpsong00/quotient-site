What is your impression of Kara?

Torn Between Ideals and Love:
 Kara struggles internally with her allegiance to the mission of the Contingent and her past relationship with Jack. She is torn between her attraction to immortality and her belief in Jack's honorable intentions​​.

Mysterious and Enigmatic:
 Her actions and true intentions often leave others, including Jack, questioning whether she is genuinely seeking an exit from her current path or if it's all a ploy​​.

Strategist:
 She is seen planning and strategizing, for example, when she knows she needs to get Jack and Sarah away from Hank quickly and does so without hesitation​​.

Playful and Manipulative:
 Kara displays a playful side, indulging in role-play, but this also hints at her manipulative abilities​​. Reflective and Doubtful: There are moments when Kara questions her own beliefs and the path she has taken, indicating a depth of character and a capacity for self-reflection​​.

Fashionable and Charismatic:
 Kara is depicted as a charismatic figure, with a keen sense of style, which she uses to her advantage in different situations​​.

A Source of Light and Passion:
 She was once a significant source of joy and passion in Jack's life, indicating a warm and lively personality​​.

Assertive and Commanding:
 Kara often takes charge of situations, commanding respect and obedience, as seen in various interactions with others​​.

Complicated Relationship with Jack:
 Her relationship with Jack is a central theme, filled with nostalgia, unresolved feelings, and a deep connection that influences many of her actions​​.

Involved in High-Stakes Scenarios:
 Kara often finds herself in high-stakes, action-packed scenarios, indicating her central role in the overarching plot of the book​​. In summary, Kara is a character of depth and contradiction, balancing protective instincts, a struggle with her ideals, and a complex relationship with Jack, all while being embroiled in the high-stakes world of "The Quantum Contingent."

Give a quick character summary of each protagonist.

"The Quantum Contingent" features a dynamic duo of protagonists, Jack and Sarah, who are siblings with a knack for espionage and high-stakes adventure. Here's a quick summary of each:        

 
Jack:
 A brilliant mind with a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, Jack is the analytical and cautious half of the sibling team. His background and expertise in quantum computing make him an invaluable asset in dealing with the complex challenges posed by the Quantum Contingent. Jack's thoughtful and methodical approach often complements his sister's more instinctive style.         

Sarah:
 Sarah is a fearless, quick-thinking spy with a penchant for action. She's resourceful and exceptionally skilled in languages and physical combat, making her a formidable field agent. Sarah's spontaneous and daring nature often leads her into challenging situations, but her quick wit and agility always seem to help her navigate through. Her deep bond and teamwork with Jack are central to their success. Together, Jack and Sarah form a compelling and complementary team, combining intellectual prowess and physical agility to tackle the threats posed by the Quantum Contingent. Their sibling dynamic adds a unique and engaging layer to their adventures, as they rely on each other's strengths to overcome the various challenges they face.
