I had the joy of attending my niece's wedding in Washington, DC last weekend. We went for a couple of extra days and made a road trip of it. This gave me a chance to do some refinement of one of my Washington, DC chapters in 
The Quantum Contingent
. There is a scene near the Watergate steps that I needed to understand the street layout to properly convey the story. So, research done... chapter edited. I am trying to portray all the locations with as much realism as possible! Of course, since it's a spy novel, I also visited the Spy Museum while I was there. Research for a good novel never ends!

​ 

The other thing I've been curating for the novel is a set of photos. Each chapter will now have a heading image like this:

In print, they will be black and white, in the eBook, if you read it on a color device, it will be in color. Of course, all the photos will be on the website as well. I've been beta testing Vellum 3.0 for formatting. Vellum is worth checking out if you are going to format a book! ​

The Quantum Contingent
 will be available on or before March 1st, 2021, I'll let you know when it's available for purchase!

Have a great day,
