Ok, it's time for pencil's down. I think the manuscript for 
The Quantum Contingent
 is now a wrap. Time to focus on getting the cover and then getting it published! Here are some random stats for those who like to hear the numbers. My biggest day of writing was 5284 words. My smallest was a net of -169. Yes, you can have negative writing days. My biggest month was last March with 37,179 words. Not surprising, since that was the first month of my retirement. So, looking back since I first started, it was 228 days of writing, for an average of 469 words per day. A total of 106,932 words written. Only about 80,000 of them made it into the final copy. These statistics average in some very low number days here towards the end. 

Interior formatting is also complete. Photos for each chapter header, nicely divided sections, drop capitals to start each chapter, etc. It was much easier than formatting my master's thesis using LaTeX.

I attended a webinar on cover design this week. This is a critical component of any book, and I hope to see some draft work by Monday from my cover designer!

I've posted the opening and closing chapter photos below.

Thanks for your patience. I hope you'll enjoy it. I'll let you know when it's available!

Greg
