This week's blog is a photo blog of two locations  in 
The Quantum Contingent
. Both are in Africa. The first is Ngorongoro Crater, in Tanzania and the second is The Rock Churches in Lalibela, Ethiopia. The cover photo from "The Journey Blog" is of Ngorongoro Crater on the jeep ride into the canyon at sunrise. The "About the Author" page features a photo of me in front of The Church of St. George. St. George stands a distance from the other churches and is hewn in the shape of a cross from a single block of red stone. These are two very unique and beautiful places. Great places for a spy novel like
 The Quantum Contingent.

I hope you enjoy the photos and the novel! I sent my "alpha copy" to my developmental editor this week. I'll get that feedback back on July 31st. Now I need to learn about book marketing and advertising! Drop me a comment below if you have any questions!

Greg
