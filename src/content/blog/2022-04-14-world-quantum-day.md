That’s right, April 14th is World Quantum Day! 
Who knew? There is no better day to try 
The Quantum Contingent
 than today! Now that 
The Quantum Contingent
 is live on Amazon I'm hearing about more people receiving their copy of the book. I just wanted to say 
thanks to all
 that have purchased the book and a very special thank you to those that have read it!

(No, I didn't plan for it to go live the week of World Quantum Day. It was just luck.)

Why is World Quantum Day on April 14th? 
(From the world quantum day website: 
[https://worldquantumday.org](https://worldquantumday.org)
)

"The World Quantum Day is celebrated on April 14, a reference to 4.14, the rounded first digits of Planck’s constant: 4.135667696×10−15 eV.s = 0,000 000 000 000 004 135667696 electronvolt second, a product of energy and time that is the fundamental constant governing quantum physics."

What about the audible version of 
The Quantum Contingent
?

The audible version is in production! It is now on Chapter 40, so it won't be long before you are reading the blog post about it's release!

Happy Quantum Day!
