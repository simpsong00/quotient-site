T
he cover of 
The Quantum Contingent
 is filled with imagery tied to the book. Much of it won't have meaning until you read the book. In this post, I'll highlight many of the images while avoiding spoilers.

First, the cross like structure at the bottom of the cover. As it says on the back of the cover, this is the rock church of St. George in Lalibela, Ethiopia. A key location in 
The Quantum Contingent.

Next, look up toward the top of the cover. This is the bottom of a rocket ship. The flame coming out of the rocket ship is in the form of a quotation mark. This symbolizes that it is a literary work. 

The prominent circle is the moon, representing space. What is that circle in front of the moon? Why does this look like an eye? What else does is resemble to you?

Sunsets and water play significant roles throughout the book. Hence the clear water and sunsets placed behind the words 
Quantum Contingent
. However, not all of those rays are sunshine... could the ray going to the edge of the book represent another rocket? Oh, and the top rocket fins bring images of a crown overtop of that thing that looks like an eye.

Finally, note how the imagery fits inside the form factor of a smartphone... there is even a notch at the bottom, like your smartphone.

So the point of this blog is simply to make sure you take a closer look at the cover 
after
 you read the book.
 There are many messages in the cover!

I want to thank my son, Jason, for masterfully designing the cover!

Talk again soon!

Greg
